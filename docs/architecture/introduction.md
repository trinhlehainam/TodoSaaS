# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for TaskFlow Pro, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines backend and frontend architecture in a **monorepo structure** as specified in the PRD, facilitating code sharing, unified CI/CD, and synchronized versioning between the Laravel API and Next.js SPA.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD, this is a **greenfield project** being built from scratch for learning purposes. The project uses:
- **Laravel Sail** for backend Docker orchestration (official Laravel development environment)
- **Create Next App** for frontend initialization with Next.js 15
- **Monorepo structure** with `backend/` and `frontend/` directories in a single repository
- No existing codebase or starter template constraints
