# TaskFlow Pro Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Build a production-ready multi-tenant SaaS task management platform for learning Laravel and modern web development
- Implement comprehensive authentication with email/password, OAuth (Google/GitHub), and 2FA support
- Create a scalable team-based workspace system for collaborative task management
- Integrate subscription billing with Stripe for monetization and feature gating
- Provide external API access with key-based authentication for third-party integrations
- Achieve enterprise-grade security with rate limiting, CORS, and secure token management
- Deliver exceptional performance with <200ms response times and intelligent caching
- Establish comprehensive testing coverage across unit, integration, and E2E tests

### Background Context
TaskFlow Pro addresses the need for a comprehensive learning project that demonstrates modern fullstack development practices. Built as a monorepo with Laravel 12.x backend and Next.js 15 frontend, it showcases enterprise patterns including modular monolith architecture, API-first design, and multi-tenant SaaS capabilities. The project serves dual purposes: as a functional task management platform and as a reference implementation for Laravel development best practices, incorporating industry-standard tools like PostgreSQL, Valkey cache, and Stripe billing.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing both backend and frontend applications with shared documentation and tooling. Structure: `/backend` (Laravel), `/frontend` (Next.js), `/docs` (shared documentation). Managed using npm/yarn workspaces for dependency management and script orchestration.

### Service Architecture
**Modular Monolith within Monorepo** - Single Laravel application with domain-separated modules (Auth, Tasks, Billing, Teams) that can evolve to microservices if needed. Clear module boundaries with repositories and service layers. Event-driven communication between modules using Laravel Events. API Gateway pattern with Laravel middleware stack for cross-cutting concerns.

### Testing Requirements
**Full Testing Pyramid** implementation:
- **Unit Tests (60%):** Jest for frontend components/hooks, Pest for backend models/services
- **Integration Tests (30%):** API endpoint testing, database integration, external service mocking
- **E2E Tests (10%):** Cypress for critical user flows, visual regression testing
- **Additional:** Mutation testing for critical business logic, performance testing for API endpoints
- **Coverage Target:** Minimum 80% code coverage with quality gates in CI/CD

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Development Environment:** Laravel Sail (Docker-based) for consistent local development
- **API Specification:** RESTful JSON:API standard with OpenAPI 3.0 documentation
- **Database Migrations:** Laravel migrations with rollback capability and seeders for test data
- **Background Jobs:** Laravel Queues with database driver (upgradeable to Redis/SQS)
- **File Storage:** Local filesystem for development, S3-compatible storage for production
- **Monitoring:** Laravel Telescope for development, Sentry for production error tracking
- **Deployment:** Containerized via Docker, deployable to AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run, or DigitalOcean
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with automated testing, code quality checks, and deployment pipelines
- **Code Standards:** Laravel Pint for PHP, Biome for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Secret Management:** Environment variables for local, AWS Secrets Manager for production
- **Performance Monitoring:** Laravel Debugbar in development, New Relic/Datadog for production
- **Email Service:** Mailpit for local development, SendGrid/Postmark for production
- **Search (Future):** Database full-text search initially, Meilisearch/Elasticsearch when needed
- **WebSockets (Future):** Pusher/Soketi for real-time updates when required
